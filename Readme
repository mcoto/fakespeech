# Implementation of a Fake Speech Detection System

## 📌 Project Description
This project aims to implement a system for the **automatic detection of synthesized speech** (fake speech / audio deepfake) using open-source models. The system will be adapted and validated in the context of **Costa Rican voices** to assess its effectiveness in detecting falsified audio.

The increasing availability of speech synthesis models (TTS and Voice Cloning) poses challenges to **security**, **information veracity**, and **trust** in digital environments. This work seeks to lay the groundwork for defense tools against these risks.

---

## 🎯 General Objective
Implement a functional fake speech detection system using existing models and evaluate its performance on Costa Rican Spanish audio.

---

## 🎯 Specific Objectives
1. Review existing open-source tools for fake speech detection.
2. Select and adapt at least one pre-trained model for local testing.
3. Collect and prepare a dataset of real and synthesized audio with Costa Rican voices.
4. Implement a system to automate detection and generate reports.
5. Evaluate system performance using relevant metrics.
6. Document the process and results.

## ▶️ How to Run the System

### 📂 Prepare the Dataset

1. Place **real audio** in:

   ```
   data/real/
   ```
2. Place **fake audio** in:

   ```
   data/fake/
   ```
3. Fill in the file:

   ```
   dataset_info.csv
   ```

   with the required metadata (e.g., filename, label, duration, source).

---

### ▶️ Run Detection

```bash
python src/detect.py
```

---

### 📄 Check Results

* Review predictions in:

  ```
  results/detections.csv
  ```
* Review calculated metrics in:

  ```
  results/metrics.json
  ```

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics will be used:

* **Accuracy**
* **Precision**
* **Recall**
* **AUC**
* **Equal Error Rate (EER)**
